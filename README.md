    - Or, alternatively, download and unzip the zip file
2. Build the project. Open a command line shell in the project directory and type the following:

While this app is in an almost-usable state, there is still some work to do. I appreciate any feedback and bug reports you are sending to me. I would also appreciate any contributions to the project, so if you want to add a feature or change something, just create a pull request!
